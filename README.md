# conway-game-of-life
The classic Conway's game of life cellular automata. Written entirely in C.

## Gameplay

Technically, this is a zero-player game, so it is not meant to be "played" per se. But in terms of how to use it:

- Use the mouse left-click to make cells alive/dead.
- Use spacebar to run/pause.
- Use 'N' key to clear all cells (reset to the starting state with no cells).

## Platform compatibility

This program uses <windows.h> to generate graphics, and is only expected to function correctly on Windows operating systems.
